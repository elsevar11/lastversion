Google Dorking Automation Project

Introduction
Google Dorking, also known as Google Hacking, is a technique to leverage Google's advanced search operators to uncover sensitive information or vulnerabilities on websites. This project automates the process of executing Google Dork queries on specific target domains using the Serpstack API.
The program can process multiple targets, handle multiple API keys, and log results into a file for analysis.

Usage Instructions
Prerequisites
1.	Python: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2.	API Keys: Obtain API keys for the Serpstack API and save them in a file (e.g., api_keys.txt).
3.	Dorks File: Create a file containing Google Dork queries (e.g., dorks.txt).
4.	Target Domains: Prepare the target domains you want to query.
Setup
1.	Save the script file (e.g., google_dorking.py) in your project directory.
2.	Install required Python modules:
bash
Copy code
pip install requests
3.	Ensure the following files are in the same directory as the script:
o	api_keys.txt (contains API keys, one per line)
o	dorks.txt,and etc (contains dork queries, one per line)
How to Run
1.	Open a terminal in the script's directory.
2.	Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
3.	Provide the required inputs:
o	Target domains: Enter the domains as a comma-separated list (e.g., example.com,example.org).
o	Dorks file path: Provide the path to the file containing dork queries (e.g., dorks.txt).
4.	Results will be written to results.txt.
Output
â€¢	The script generates an output file (results.txt) containing the results for each query, including:
o	The dork query executed.
o	The list of discovered links for each query.

Features and Advantages
Features
1.	Multiple Targets: Supports querying multiple domains simultaneously using OR operators.
2.	API Key Rotation: Automatically switches API keys when one reaches its limit, ensuring continuous operation.
3.	Error Handling:
o	Handles API errors like rate limits or usage limits gracefully.
o	Retries operations after a delay when appropriate.
4.	Configurable Results: Allows the user to specify the number of results per query (default is 10, customizable).
5.	Detailed Logging: Logs the results of each query and any errors encountered during execution.
6.	Delay Between Queries: Implements a delay between requests to avoid triggering rate limits.
Advantages
1.	Automation: Saves time by automating repetitive queries.
2.	Efficiency: Uses multiple API keys to handle high volumes of requests without interruption.
3.	Scalability: Can process a large number of dorks and targets.
4.	Accuracy: Retrieves accurate results from Google using the Serpstack API.
5.	Customizability: Easy to modify the code to adjust parameters or add new features.
6.	Convenience: Outputs all results in a structured format for easy analysis.

Potential Use Cases
1.	Cybersecurity Analysis: Identify sensitive files, exposed directories, or vulnerable systems on a target domain.
2.	Penetration Testing: Automate reconnaissance steps in ethical hacking engagements.
3.	OSINT (Open Source Intelligence): Collect publicly available information about a target for investigative purposes.
________________________________________
Limitations
1.	API Dependency: Relies on the Serpstack API, which may have usage limits depending on your subscription.
2.	Query Restrictions: The accuracy of results depends on the API's search capabilities, which might differ slightly from Google's direct search engine.
3.	Resource Intensive: Processing a large number of dorks and targets may take considerable time, depending on API limits and delays.

Future Improvements
1.	Parallel Processing: Implement multithreading or multiprocessing to handle multiple queries simultaneously, improving performance.
2.	Advanced Error Handling: Add retry logic for specific HTTP errors to make the tool more robust.
3.	Results Parsing: Enhance result parsing to extract metadata like titles and descriptions along with URLs.
4.	Email Alerts: Notify users via email if the script encounters an issue or when it completes execution.
5.	Web Interface: Develop a web-based front end for easier interaction and monitoring.

Conclusion
This Google Dorking Automation Project simplifies and enhances the reconnaissance phase of penetration testing and OSINT investigations. By automating the execution of complex queries and managing API limits, it empowers security professionals to focus on analyzing results rather than performing repetitive tasks.
